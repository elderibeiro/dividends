### Dividend Yield: A financial ratio that measures the amount of dividends paid out by a company relative to its stock price.

- Formula: ```Annual Dividend per Share / Stock Price per Share = Dividend Yield```

- Example: If a company pays an annual dividend of $2 per share and its stock price is $50, then its dividend yield is 4% (i.e., $2 / $50).

### Trailing Annual Dividend Yield: A calculation of the dividend yield over the past 12 months.

- Formula: ```(Annual Dividend per Share / Stock Price per Share) x 100 = Trailing Annual Dividend Yield```

- Example: If a company paid a total of $2.50 in dividends over the past year and its current stock price is $60, then its trailing annual dividend yield is 4.17% (i.e., $2.50 / $60 x 100).

### Trailing Annual Dividend Rate: The total amount of dividends paid out by a company over the past 12 months.

- Formula: ```Annual Dividend per Share x Number of Shares = Trailing Annual Dividend Rate```

- Example: If a company pays an annual dividend of $1 per share and has 1 million outstanding shares, then its trailing annual dividend rate is $1 million.
